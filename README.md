# Lean

These are small courseworks and lecture notes for the formal reasoning part of COMP2009: Algorithms Correctness and Efficiency. The main goal is to teach formal logic using an interactive proof system called Lean. You will be able to use predicate logic to make precise statements and to verify them using a proof system. The covers both statements in Mathematics and statements about computer programs, e.g. their correctness. (http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psztxa/comp2009.21.ifr-notes/_build/html/introduction.html)

1. Propositional logic
2. Classical logic
3. Predicate logic
4. The Booleans
